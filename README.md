# Data Engineering with Python & PySpark

## 1. Understanding Big Data

### 1.1 The Big Data Landscape

Big Data represents the paradigm shift in how we process and analyze information in the digital age. Unlike traditional 
data processing, which focuses on structured, manageable datasets, Big Data tackles the challenges posed by massive, 
complex, and rapidly evolving data ecosystems.
It's a problem related to handling data, specifically with storage and processing

### 1.2 The 5 V's of Big Data 

#### 1.2.1 Volume
- **Definition**: The sheer scale of data being generated and stored
- **Challenges**:
  - Storage limitations of traditional databases
  - Processing power requirements
  - Data transfer bottlenecks
- **Real-world Example**: 
  - Social media platforms generate over 2.5 quintillion bytes of data daily
  - A single autonomous vehicle can generate 20TB of data daily

#### 1.2.2 Velocity
- **Definition**: The speed at which data is generated and processed
- **Key Aspects**:
  - Real-time processing requirements
  - Stream processing capabilities
  - Event-time processing
- **Use Cases**:
  - Fraud detection in financial transactions
  - IoT sensor data processing
  - Real-time recommendation systems

#### 1.2.3 Variety
- **Data Types**:
  - **Structured**: 
    - Tabular data with fixed schema
    - Examples: SQL databases, CSV files
  - **Semi-structured**:
    - Self-describing formats
    - Examples: JSON, XML, Avro, Parquet
  - **Unstructured**:
    - No predefined format
    - Examples: Text documents, images, videos, social media posts

#### 1.2.4 Veracity
- **Aspects**:
  - Data quality management
  - Data cleaning and validation
  - Handling missing or inconsistent data
- **Strategies**:
  - Data profiling
  - Anomaly detection
  - Data quality rules

#### 1.2.5 Value
- **Extraction Methods**:
  - Business intelligence
  - Machine learning models
  - Predictive analytics
- **ROI Considerations**:
  - Infrastructure costs
  - Processing efficiency
  - Business impact
